Description: The vswift package streamlines model evaluation by providing tools to perform train-test splitting and cross-validation. It supports a wide range of popular classification algorithms, including logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks, decision trees, random forests, multinomial logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting.
